# Allele Specific Expression and Methylation in *Bombus terrestris*.

This is a repository for the code for the following publication:
Marshall, H., Jones, A., Lonsdale, Z. N., & Mallon, E.B. (2020). Bumblebee workers show differences in allele-specific methylation and allele-specific expression. <i>Genome Biology and Evolution</i>. DOI:https://doi.org/10.1093/gbe/evaa132

## Project Team: 

This project is part of the work from the Social Epigenetics group at the Unviersity of Leicester, headed by Dr. Eamonn Mallon, [see website](https://www2.le.ac.uk/projects/selab). Data was generated by Dr. Hollie Marshall and Dr. Zoe Lonsdale. Alun Jones contributed to the allele-specific expression pipeline and GO analysis. Dr. Hollie Marshall contributed to the allele-specific expression pipeline and conducted all other analyses.
