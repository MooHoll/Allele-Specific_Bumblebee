# Allele Specific Expression and Methylation in *Bombus terrestris*.

[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.1974852.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1974852)

Allele-specific expression and methylation has been identified in *Bombus terrestris* previously [here](https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj.3798). The aim of this project is to examine allele-specific expression and methylation at base-pair resolution and identify any links between the two. 

The code generated here can be used to identify allele-specific expression in other organisms and the methylation pipeline will be particularly useful for organisms with low-levels of methylation, e.g. 0.5% CpGs. 

## Project Team: 

This project is part of the work from the Social Epigenetics group at the Unviersity of Leicester, headed by Dr. Eamonn Mallon, see [see website](https://www2.le.ac.uk/projects/selab). Data was generated by Hollie Marshall and Dr. Zoe Lonsdale. Alun Jones is currently working on the allele-specific expression pipeline and Hollie Marshall is currently working on the allele-specific methylation pipeline. 

## Project Sturcture and Status

- Data cleaning and mapping **done**
- Alleleically methylated genes identified **done**
- Alleleically expressed genes identified *in progress*
- Linking data 
- Making all code avaliable *in progess*
- Writing up
